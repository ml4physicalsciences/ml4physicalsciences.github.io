							<h2>Submission instructions and review process</h2>
						</header>

						<h3>Instructions for preparing submissions</h3>

						<ul>
							<li>For the the three tracks, submissions should be short papers (extended
								abstracts) up to 4 pages in PDF
								format, typeset using the <a
									href="https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2024/Styles.zip">
									NeurIPS paper
									template</a> for the <it>Research</it> and <it>Perspectives</it> tracks, and the
								<a href="https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2024/NeurIPS-Dataset-Styles.zip">NeurIPS
									Dataset template</a> for the <it>Datasets & Benchmarks</it> track.
							</li>
							<li>
								The review process will happen on OpenReview and submissions shall be submitted on the
								workshop <a
									href="https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/ML4PS">OpenReview
									page</a>.
							</li>
							<li>Unlimited references are allowed and do not count against the 4-page limit.</li>
							<!-- <li>The authors are required to include a short statement (approximately one paragraph)
								about the potential broader impact of their work, including any ethical aspects and
								future societal consequences, which may be positive or negative. The broader impact
								statement should come after the main paper content. The impact statement and references
								do not count towards the page limit. </li> -->
							<!-- <li>The NeurIPS style template includes a paper checklist intended to encourage best
								practices for responsible machine learning research (see <a
									href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist">associated
									guidelines</a>). </li> -->
							<li>Appendices are discouraged, and reviewers will not be required to read beyond the
								first 4 pages. </li>
							<li>Workshop organizers retain the right to reject submissions for editorial reasons: for
								example, any paper surpassing the page limitation or modifying the NeurIPS template will
								be desk rejected.
							</li>
							<li>We invite authors to follow the <a
									href="https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist">guidelines and best
									practices</a> from the NeurIPS conference (see also the main conference <a
									href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks">datasets and
									benchmarks call</a> for guidelines pertaining to the Dataset Track). A checklist or
								broader impact statement is not required to be included with the submission. You are
								however welcome to add a short broader impact statement, which will not count towards
								the 4-page submission limit.</li>
							<li>All authors must be registered as authors at the time of submission. <b>We will not allow authors to be added after the review process has begun.</b> </li>
							<li>Submissions will be kept confidential until they are accepted and until authors confirm
								that they can be included in the workshop. If a submission is not accepted, or withdrawn
								for any reason, it will be kept confidential and not made public. </li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Instructions for Datasets & Benchmarks track</h3>

						<p>The following additionally apply to this track.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								In line with the main-track Datasets & Benchmarks call, since full anonymization can
								be difficult for datasets, it will not be required for this track.
							</li>
							<li>Availability of dataset(s): The dataset(s) must be publicly available at the time of
								the
								workshop (e.g., via Zenodo). The submission must also include baseline results and
								public
								code (the baselines need not use machine learning). Additional data artifacts (e.g.
								a public
								simulator) may also be included and described in the submission.</li>
							<li>The submitted paper should describe the following:
								<ul>
									<li>Properties of the dataset/benchmark;</li>
									<li>The scientific and/or computational challenges addressed by releasing the
										dataset/benchmark;</li>
									<li>Existing methods and/or potential solutions that ML could provide.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>


						<h3>Review process</h3>

						<p>Submissions that follow the submission instructions correctly (i.e., are not rejected due to
							editorial reasons, such as exceeding the page limit or tampering with the template format)
							are
							sent for double-blind peer review. Below are some of the key points about this process that
							are shared
							with the reviewers and authors alike. Authors are expected to consider these in preparation
							of their submissions and when deciding to apply for the reviewer role.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Papers are 4 pages long. Appendices are accepted but discouraged; the reviewers
								will not be required to read the appendices. </li>
							<li>There will be multiple reviewers for each paper.</li>
							<li>Reviewers will be able to state their confidence in their review.</li>
							<li>We will provide an easy-to-follow template for reviews so that both the pros and the
								cons of the submission can be highlighted.</li>
							<li>Paper matching will be done via the OpenReview system</li>
							<li>Potential conflicts of interest based on institution and author collaboration are
								addressed through the OpenReview system.</li>
							<li>Criteria for a successful submission include: novelty, correctness, relevance to the
								field, at the intersection of ML and physical sciences, and showing promise for future
								impact. Negative or null results that add value and insight are welcome.</li>
							<li>There will be no rebuttal period. Minor flaws will not be the sole reason to reject a
								paper. Incomplete works at an advanced progress stage are welcome. </li>
						</ul>
