							<h2>About</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							The <strong>Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences</strong> workshop aims to provide an
							informal, inclusive, and leading-edge venue for discussing research and challenges at the
							intersection of machine learning (ML) and the physical sciences (PS). This includes the
							applications of ML to problems in the physical sciences (ML for PS) as well as developments
							in ML motivated by physical insights (PS for ML).
						</p>
						<p><strong>PS is defined inclusively, including but not limited to physics, astronomy,
								cosmology, chemistry, biophysics, materials science, and Earth science.</strong>
						</p>

						<p>Recent years have highlighted unique opportunities as well as challenges in incorporating ML
							workflows as part of the scientific process in many physical sciences. For example, fields
							focused on fundamental physics discovery, such as particle physics and cosmology, often have
							stringent requirements for exactness, robustness, and latency that go beyond those typically
							encountered in other scientific domains and industry applications. Data preservation and
							workflow reproducibility are other central challenges that need to be addressed in the era
							of large experiments, collaborations, and datasets. In these fields and others, simulations
							play a central role in connecting theoretical models to observations. The ubiquity and
							increasing complexity of simulators in PS has spurred methodological advances in ML, e.g. in
							simulation-based inference and differentiable programming, that are finding applications far
							beyond PS, showcasing the bidirectional nature of the PS-ML intersection.</p>

						<p>The breadth of work at the intersection of ML and physical sciences is answering many
							important questions for both fields while opening up new ones that can only be addressed by
							a joint effort of both communities. By bringing together ML researchers and physical
							scientists who apply and study ML, we expect to strengthen the much needed interdisciplinary
							dialogue, introduce exciting new open problems to the broader community, and stimulate the
							production of new approaches to solving challenging open problems in the sciences. Invited
							talks from leading individuals in both communities will cover the state-of-the-art
							techniques and set the stage for this workshop, which will also include contributed talks
							selected from submissions.</p>

						<p>The invited talks program will showcase unique features of the physical sciences that
							highlight current challenges and bidirectional opportunities in ML and PS. This includes the
							central role of simulators in the scientific process, the need for rigorous uncertainty
							quantification, and the development of hardware-software co-design solutions for real-time
							inference. </p>

						<p>A part of the workshop program will be dedicated to the <strong>focus area</strong>
							discussing
							the role of data-driven vs inductive bias-driven methods in machine learning and the
							physical sciences, centering the emerging role of foundation models and their
							complementarity with approaches leveraging physical inductive biases. This will feature an
							overview talk, followed by a moderated panel discussion.

							<h2>Call for external contributions</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							In this workshop, we aim to bring together physical scientists and machine learning
							researchers who work at the intersection of these fields
						<ul>
							<li>by
								Applying machine learning to problems in the physical sciences -- physics, chemistry,
								astronomy, earth science, biophysics, and related sciences; and
							</li>
							<li>Using physical insights to understand and/or improve machine learning techniques,
								for instance building hybrid machine learning algorithms that leverage physical
								models with machine learning blocks to create interpretable and accurate predictive
								models.</li>
						</ul>

						To this purpose, we encourage external contributions, which will be presented during
						in-person poster sessions during the workshop. Selected contributions will be offered
						15-minute contributed talks.
						</p>

						<p>
							Submissions should be anonymized short papers (extended abstracts) up to 4 pages
							(excluding references). We invite authors to follow the <a
								href="https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist">guidelines and best
								practices</a>
							from the NeurIPS conference (see also the main conference <a
								href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks">datasets and
								benchmarks call</a>
							for guidelines pertaining to the Dataset Track). Please ensure that your paper is
							approachable by someone not an expert in your specific area of physical science. For
							example, please avoid or at least define jargon. We reserve the right to desk reject any
							submissions that do not conform to the format. The review process is double-blind
							(optionally, single-blind for the Datasets & Benchmarks track). All authors must be
							registered in the submission system at the time of submission. We will not allow authors
							to be added after the review process has begun. This workshop is not archival so we will
							consider papers containing content that is published in an archival venue other than the
							main NeurIPS conference (e.g. a physics journal). However, such papers will likely need
							to be rewritten to fit the format and venue.

						</p>

						<p>
							<em>Submission instuctions:</em> <a

								link.</a> See <a
								href="https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2024/guidelines.html">here</a> for
							additional instructions on preparing submissions to the workshop.

						</p>

						<p>
							<em>We need you!</em>
							If you consider submitting at the workshop, please also consider helping us with reviews.
							You
							can opt-in for the maximum number of papers you would like to review <a

						</p>

						<p>
							This year's workshop will feature three tracks for external contributions:
						</p>

						<h3>Research abstract </h3>
						We invite researchers to submit original work in the following areas or areas related to
						them:
						<ul>
							<li>ML for Physics: Innovative applications of machine learning to the physical
								sciences; Machine learning model interpretability for obtaining insights into
								physical systems; Automating/accelerating elements of the scientific process
								(experimental design, data collection, statistical analysis, etc.).
							</li>
							<li>Physics in ML: Strategies for incorporating scientific knowledge or methods into
								machine learning models and algorithms; Applications of physical science methods and
								processes to understand, model, and improve machine learning models and algorithms.
							</li>
							<li>Any other area related to the subject of the workshop, including but not limited to
								probabilistic methods that are relevant to physical systems, such as deep generative
								models, scientific foundation models, probabilistic programming, simulation-based
								inference, variational inference, causal inference, etc.
							</li>
						</ul>
						The NeurIPS program features multiple workshops at the intersection between domain Science
						and machine learning (see the <a href="#related_wps">list of related workshops below</a>). We
						refer to the authors'
						best judgment for selecting which workshop is the most appropriate for submitting their
						work.
						<h3>Datasets & Benchmarks abstract</h3>
						We invite researchers to submit papers describing a dataset/benchmark and the related
						computational or scientific challenge that may benefit from innovative research at the
						intersection of ML and Physical Sciences. Authors should ensure their submission fulfills
						the following minimum requirements:
						<ul>
							<li>Availability of dataset(s): The dataset(s) must be publicly available at the time of
								the
								workshop (e.g., via Zenodo). The submission must also include baseline results and
								public
								code (the baselines need not use machine learning). Additional data artifacts (e.g.
								a public
								simulator) may also be included and described in the submission.</li>
							<li>The submitted paper should describe the following:
								<ul>
									<li>Properties of the dataset/benchmark;</li>
									<li>The scientific and/or computational challenges addressed by releasing the
										dataset/benchmark;</li>
									<li>Existing methods and/or potential solutions that ML could provide.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								In line with the main track Datasets & Benchmarks call, since full anonymization can
								be
								difficult for datasets, it will not be required for this track.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Perspectives abstract</h3>
						<p>This year, we introduce a new Perspectives track, where researchers have the opportunity to
							present compelling and grounded viewpoints on recent directions and open questions at the
							intersection of ML and Physical Sciences. This track encourages disseminating perspectives
							on
							past, present, or future challenges of interest to scientists working at the intersection
							between ML and Physical Sciences.The track aims to stimulate productive and respectful
							conversations on timely topics that will benefit from the ML4PS workshop's attendees' input.
							Position papers should meet standard scientific rigor, including using evidence and
							reasoning to
							support claims, including relevant background and context, and attributing others' work via
							appropriate citations. Accepted Perspectives will be presented at the workshop during the
							poster
							sessions.
						</p>

						<h4>Code sharing & reproducibility guidance:</h4>
						<p>While we do not enforce it, we will highlight submissions containing documented code and
							reproducible workflows through a Reproducibility Badge.</p>

						<h4>Double-submission policy:</h4>
						<p>While we primarily encourage the submission of original pieces of work, we also accept
							submissions that are extended abstract versions of already published work if their topic
							fits
							particularly well with the workshop's scope.
							In contrast, with the objective of respecting the hard work of reviewers and giving equal
							chances to all submissions, we strictly prohibit submitting to multiple workshops
							simultaneously. Submissions flagged as coincidentally submitted to multiple neurips
							workshops
							will be desk rejected.</p>
