							<h2>Submission instructions and review process</h2>
						</header>

						<h3>Instructions for preparing submissions</h3>

						<p><strong>Anonymization policy: </strong>

  						The review process is double-blind (optionally, single-blind for the Datasets & Benchmarks track). Outside of the Datasets & Benchmarks track, <b>papers must be fully anonymized</b>. This means that code, links, and all text and figures should be anonymized as well. Authors are welcome to use tools such as <a href=https://anonymous.4open.science/>Anonymous Github</a> to share anonymized code with reviewers.</p>

							<p><strong>Policy on previously published work: </strong>
							While we primarily encourage the submission of original works, we also accept submissions that are extended abstract versions of already published work if the topic fits particularly well with the workshop's scope. This workshop is not archival, so we will
							consider papers containing content that is published in an archival venue other than the
							main NeurIPS conference (e.g. a physics journal). However, such papers will likely need to
							be rewritten to fit the format and venue.
							
							<p><strong>Double-submission policy: </strong>
							Please note that the NeurIPS program features multiple workshops at the intersection between domain science and machine learning. In order to respect the hard work of reviewers and give equal chances to all submissions, <b>we strictly prohibit submitting to multiple workshops simultaneously</b>. We refer to the authors' best judgment for selecting which workshop is the most appropriate for submitting their work. Submissions flagged as coincidentally submitted to multiple NeurIPS workshops will be desk rejected. 
 						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>For each track, submissions should be <b>short papers up to 4 pages in length</b> in a PDF
								format, typeset using the <a
									href="https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip">
									NeurIPS paper
									template</a>. We reserve the right to desk reject any
							submissions that do not conform to the format.
							</li>
							<li>Papers should be submitted via the workshop's <a
								href="https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/ML4PS">OpenReview
								page</a>.</li>

							<li>Unlimited references are allowed and do not count against the 4-page limit.</li>
							<!-- <li>The authors are required to include a short statement (approximately one paragraph)
								about the potential broader impact of their work, including any ethical aspects and
								future societal consequences, which may be positive or negative. The broader impact
								statement should come after the main paper content. The impact statement and references
								do not count towards the page limit. </li> -->
							<!-- <li>The NeurIPS style template includes a paper checklist intended to encourage best
								practices for responsible machine learning research (see <a
									href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist">associated
									guidelines</a>). </li> -->
							<li>Appendices are discouraged, and reviewers will not be required to read beyond the
								first 4 pages. </li>
							<li>Workshop organizers retain the right to reject submissions for editorial reasons: for
								example, any paper surpassing the page limitation or modifying the NeurIPS template will
								be desk rejected.
							</li>
							<li>We suggest that authors follow the <a
									href="https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist">guidelines and best
									practices</a> from the NeurIPS conference.
								</li>
								<li>Neither the paper checklist nor a
								broader impact statement are required for workshop submissions. If you wish to include a short broader impact statement, you are welcome to at the end of your paper, and it will not count towards the 4-page submission limit.</li>
							<li>All authors must be registered as authors at the time of submission. <b>We will not allow authors to be added after the review process has begun.</b> </li>
							<li>Submissions will be kept confidential until they are accepted and until authors confirm
								that they can be included in the workshop. If a submission is not accepted, or withdrawn
								for any reason, it will be kept confidential and not made public. </li>
								<li>Please ensure that your
							paper is approachable by someone not an expert in your specific area of physical science.
							For example, please avoid or at least define jargon.</li>
						</ul>

 

						<h4>Additional Instructions for the Datasets & Benchmarks track</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Since full anonymization can
								be difficult for datasets, it will not be required for this track.
							</li>
							<li>The dataset(s) must be publicly available at the time of
								the
								workshop (e.g., via Zenodo). The submission must also include baseline results and
								public
								code (the baselines need not use machine learning). Additional data artifacts (e.g.
								a public
								simulator) may also be included and described in the submission.</li>
							<li>The submitted paper should describe the following:
								<ul>
									<li>Properties of the dataset/benchmark;</li>
									<li>The scientific and/or computational challenges addressed by releasing the
										dataset/benchmark;</li>
									<li>Existing methods and/or potential solutions that ML could provide.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

<br><br>

						<h4>Additional Instructions for the Perspectives track</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Position papers should meet standard scientific rigor, including using evidence and reasoning to support claims, including relevant background and context, and attributing others' work via appropriate citations.</li>
							<li>Papers should be fully-anonymized.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Review process</h3>

						<p>Submissions that follow the submission instructions correctly (i.e., are not rejected due to
							editorial reasons, such as exceeding the page limit or tampering with the template format)
							are sent for peer review. The review process takes place on OpenReview. Below are some of the key points about this process that
							are shared
							with the reviewers and authors alike. Authors are expected to consider these in preparation
							of their submissions and when deciding to apply for the reviewer role.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Papers are 4 pages long. Appendices are accepted but discouraged; the reviewers will not be required to read the appendices. </li>
							<li>There will be multiple reviewers for each paper.</li>
							<li>Reviewers will be able to state their confidence in their review.</li>
							<li>We will provide an easy-to-follow template for reviews so that both the pros and the cons of the submission can be highlighted.</li>
							<li>Paper matching will be done via the OpenReview system.</li>
							<li>Potential conflicts of interest based on institution and author collaboration are
								addressed through the OpenReview system.</li>
							<li>Criteria for a successful submission include: novelty, correctness, relevance to the
								field, at the intersection of ML and physical sciences, and showing promise for future
								impact. Negative or null results that add value and insight are welcome.</li>
							<li>There will be no rebuttal period. Minor flaws will not be the sole reason to reject a paper. Incomplete works at an advanced progress stage are welcome. </li>
						</ul>
