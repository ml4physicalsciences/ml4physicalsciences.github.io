							<h2>About</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							The <strong>Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences</strong> workshop aims to provide an
							informal, inclusive and leading-edge venue for research and discussions at the interface of
							machine learning (ML) and the physical sciences. This interface spans (1) applications of ML
							in physical sciences (<emph>ML for physics</emph>), (2) developments in ML motivated by
							physical insights (<emph>physics for ML</emph>), and most recently (3) convergence of ML and
							physical sciences (<emph>physics with ML</emph>) which inspires questioning what scientific
							understanding means in the age of complex-AI powered science, and what roles machine and
							human scientists will play in developing scientific understanding in the future.
						</p>

						<p>Recent years have seen a tremendous increase in cases where ML models are used for scientific
							processing and discovery, and similarly, instances where tools and insights from the
							physical sciences are brought to the study of ML models. The harmonious co-development of
							the two fields is not a surprise: ML methods have had great success in learning complex
							representations of data that enable novel modeling and data processing approaches in many
							scientific disciplines. Indeed, in some sense, ML and physics are concerned with a shared
							goal of characterizing the true probability distributions of nature. As ML and physical
							science research becomes more intertwined, questions naturally arise around what scientific
							understanding is when science is performed with the assistance of complex and highly
							parameterized models.</p>
						<!-- Taken to the extreme, if an ML model is developed for a scientific
							task and demonstrates robustness and generalizability but lacks interpretability in terms of
							an existing scientific knowledge basis, is this still a useful scientific result?</p> -->

						<p>The breadth of work at the intersection of ML and physical sciences is answering many
							important questions for both fields while opening up new ones that can only be addressed by
							a joint effort of both communities. By bringing together ML researchers and physical
							scientists who apply and study ML, we expect to strengthen the much needed interdisciplinary
							dialogue, introduce exciting new open problems to the broader community, and stimulate the
							production of new approaches to solving challenging open problems in the sciences. Invited
							talks from leading individuals in both communities will cover the state-of-the-art
							techniques and set the stage for this workshop, which will also include contributed talks
							selected from submissions.</p>

						<p>A part of the workshop program will be dedicated to a <strong>focus area</strong> discussing
							a concrete open question of
							interest to the
							community: the role of inductive bias and interpretability in PS with ML, and the role of
							physically-informed inductive biases in ML models.
							This critical and ongoing conversation because it gets to the heart of what it means to
							do science in the era of deep learning. The program will also feature a <strong>moderated
								panel</strong>
							discussion on "Funding and
							Institutional Support for Machine Learning and Physical Sciences Research" -- a topic of
							urgent current interest to researchers as the nascent field is rallying for institutional
							support across university departments, national labs, government-funded AI institutes, and
							industry.
							<!-- The panel will feature experts from these institutions, as well as managers from funding
							agencies, with the goal of discussing paths forward. -->
							The goal of the panel will be to elucidate for researchers across many career stages the
							various support mechanisms available for this intersectional field and future prospects.

						<p>In this workshop, we aim to bring together physical scientists and machine learning
							researchers
							who work at the intersection of these fields by
						<ul>
							<li>
								Applying machine learning to problems in the physical sciences – physics, chemistry,
								astronomy, materials science, biophysics, and related sciences; and
							</li>
							<li>Using physical insights to understand and/or improve machine learning techniques.</li>
						</ul>

						In this year's workshop, there are two (2) tracks:</p>

						<h3>Research Track</h3>

						We invite researchers to submit original work in the following
						areas or areas related to them.
						<ul>
							<li>ML for Physics: Innovative applications of machine learning to the physical sciences;
								Machine learning model interpretability for obtaining insights to physical systems;
								Automating/accelerating elements of the scientific process (experimental design, data
								collection, statistical analysis, etc.).
							</li>
							<li>Physics in ML: Strategies for incorporating scientific knowledge or methods into machine
								learning models and algorithms; Applications of physical science methods and processes
								to understand, model, and improve machine learning models and algorithms.
							</li>

								Any other area related to the subject of the workshop, including but not limited to
								probabilistic methods that are relevant to physical systems, such as deep generative
								models, probabilistic programming, simulation-based inference, variational inference,
								causal inference, etc.

							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Dataset Track</h3>

						We invite researchers to submit papers describing a dataset and the related
						computational or scientific challenge that may benefit from innovative research at the
						intersection of ML and Physical Sciences.
						<ul>
							<li>Availability of data set: The dataset must be publicly available at the time of the
								workshop
								(e.g., via Zenodo). The submission must also include a baseline result along with public
								code
								(the baseline need not use machine learning). Additional data artifacts (e.g. a public
								simulator) may also be included and described in the submission.</li>
							<li>The submitted paper should describe the the following:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Properties of the dataset.</li>
								<li>The scientific and/or computational challenges.</li>
								<li>Existing methods and/or potential solutions that could be provided by ML.</li>

							</ul>

						</ul>

						<p>We invite authors to follow the <a
								href="https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist">guidelines
								and best practices</a> from the NeurIPS conference
							(see
							also the main conference <a
								href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks">datasets
								and benchmarks call</a> for guidelines pertaining to the Dataset Track).
							Please
							ensure
							that
							your
							paper is approachable by someone who is not an expert in your specific area of physical
							science.
							For example, please avoid or at least define jargon. We reserve the right to desk reject any
							submissions that do not conform to the format. The review process is double blind. All
							authors
							must be registered in the submission system at the time of submission. We will not allow
							authors
							to be added after the review process has begun. This workshop is not archival so we will
							consider papers containing content that is published in an archival venue other than the
							main
							NeurIPS conference (e.g. a physics journal). However, such papers will likely need to be
							rewritten to fit the format and venue.</p>

							keep the authors preference for in-person/virtual poster presentations in mind during this
							selection. The remaining posters can be presented during the virtual poster session, and
							through the 5 minutes videos that will be uploaded to the workshop website.</p> -->

						<h3>Important note for work that will be/has been published elsewhere</h3>
						<p>All accepted works will be made available on the workshop website. This does not constitute
							an archival publication or formal proceedings; authors retain full copyright of their work
							and are free to publish their extended work in another journal or conference. We allow
							submission of works that overlap with papers that are under review or have been recently
							published in a conference or a journal, including physical science journals. However, we do
							not accept cross-submissions of the same content to multiple workshops at NeurIPS. (Check
							the <a href="https://blog.neurips.cc/2023/07/13/announcing-the-neurips-2023-workshops/">list
