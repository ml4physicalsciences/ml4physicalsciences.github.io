							<h2>Submission instructions and review process</h2>
						</header>

						<h3>Instructions for preparing submissions</h3>

						<ul>
							<li>Submissions should be anonymized short papers (extended abstracts) up to 4 pages in PDF
								format, typeset using the <a
									href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NeurIPS paper
									template</a>. </li>
							<li>Unlimited references are allowed and do not count against the 4-page limit.</li>
							<!-- <li>The authors are required to include a short statement (approximately one paragraph)
								about the potential broader impact of their work, including any ethical aspects and
								future societal consequences, which may be positive or negative. The broader impact
								statement should come after the main paper content. The impact statement and references
								do not count towards the page limit. </li> -->
							<!-- <li>The NeurIPS style template includes a paper checklist intended to encourage best
								practices for responsible machine learning research (see <a
									href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist">associated
									guidelines</a>). </li> -->
							<li>Appendices are highly discouraged, and reviewers will not be required to read beyond the
								first 4 pages and the impact statement. </li>
							<li>A workshop-specific modified NeurIPS style file will be provided for the camera-ready
								versions, after the author notification date. </li>
							<li>Workshop organizers retain the right to reject submissions for editorial reasons: for
								example, any paper surpassing the page limitation or modifying the NeurIPS template will
								be desk rejected.
							</li>
							<li>We invite authors to follow the <a
									href="https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist">guidelines
									and best practices</a> from the NeurIPS conference
								(see
								also the main conference <a
									href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks">datasets
									and benchmarks call</a> for guidelines pertaining to the Dataset Track).</li>
							<li>All authors must be registered in the submission system at the time of submission. We
								will not allow authors to be added after the review process has begun. </li>
							<li>Submissions will be kept confidential until they are accepted and until authors confirm
								that they can be included in the workshop. If a submission is not accepted, or withdrawn
								for any reason, it will be kept confidential and not made public. </li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Review process</h3>

						<p>Submissions that follow the submission instructions correctly (i.e., are not rejected due to
							editorial reasons, such as exceeding the page limit or tampering with the template format)
							are
							sent for double-blind peer review. Below are some of the key points about this process that
							are shared
							with the reviewers and authors alike. Authors are expected to consider these in preparation
							of their submissions and when deciding to apply for the reviewer role.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Papers are 4 pages long. Appendices are accepted but highly discouraged; the reviewers
								will not be required to read the appendices. </li>
							<li>There will be multiple reviewers for each paper.</li>
							<li>Reviewers will be able to state their confidence in their review.</li>
							<li>We will provide an easy-to-follow template for reviews so that both the pros and the
								cons of the submission can be highlighted.</li>
							<li>Reviewers will select their field of expertise so that each submission has reviewers
								from multiple fields. During the matching process, the same list of subject fields is
								used for submissions and reviewer expertise in order to maximize the quality of reviews.
							</li>
							<li>Potential conflicts of interest based on institution and author collaboration are
								addressed through the CMT review system.</li>
							<li>Criteria for a successful submission include: novelty, correctness, relevance to the
								field, at the intersection of ML and physical sciences, and showing promise for future
								impact. Negative or null results that add value and insight are welcome.</li>
							<li>There will be no rebuttal period. Minor flaws will not be the sole reason to reject a
								paper. Incomplete works at an advanced progress stage are welcome. </li>
						</ul>
