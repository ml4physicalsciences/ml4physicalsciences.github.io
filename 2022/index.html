											<h2>About</h2>
										</header>

										<p>
										The <strong>Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences</strong> workshop aims to provide an informal, inclusive and leading-edge venue for research and discussions at the interface of machine learning (ML) and the physical sciences. This interface spans applications of ML in physical sciences (<emph>ML for physics</emph>), (2) developments in ML motivated by physical insights (<emph>physics for ML</emph>), and most recently (3) convergence of ML and physical sciences (<emph>physics with ML</emph>) which inspires questioning what scientific understanding means in the age of complex-AI powered science, and what roles machine and human scientists will play in developing scientific understanding in the future.
										</p>

										<p>Recent years have seen a tremendous increase in cases where ML models are used for scientific processing and discovery, and similarly, instances where tools and insights from the physical sciences are brought to the study of ML models. The harmonious co-development of the two fields is not a surprise: ML methods have had great success in learning complex representations of data that enable novel modeling and data processing approaches in many scientific disciplines. Indeed, in some sense, ML and physics are concerned with a shared goal of characterizing the true probability distributions of nature. As ML and physical science research becomes more intertwined, questions naturally arise around what scientific understanding is when science is performed with the assistance of complex and highly parameterized models. Taken to the extreme, if an ML model is developed for a scientific task and demonstrates robustness and generalizability but lacks interpretability in terms of an existing scientific knowledge basis, is this still a useful scientific result?</p>
										
										<p>The breadth of work at the intersection of ML and physical sciences is answering many important questions for both fields while opening up new ones that can only be addressed by a joint effort of both communities. By bringing together ML researchers and physical scientists who apply and study ML, we expect to strengthen the much needed interdisciplinary dialogue, introduce exciting new open problems to the broader community, and stimulate the production of new approaches to solving challenging open problems in the sciences. Invited talks from leading individuals in both communities will cover the state-of-the-art techniques and set the stage for this workshop, which will also include contributed talks selected from submissions. The workshop will also feature an expert panel discussion on ``Philosophy of Science in the AI Era" --- focusing on topics such as scientific understanding in the age of extremely complex ML models, automating science via machines, and ML models as source of inspiration for scientific discoveries. Finally, there will be multiple community building activities such as a voluntary mentorship opportunity and round table discussions on curated topics to foster connection building and facilitate knowledge sharing across disciplines, backgrounds, and career stages.</p>

								<h2>How to attend</h2>
								<p>The workshop is taking place on Monday, December 13, 2021. It will be a combination of: (1) live invited talks, Q&A sessions, and panel discussion, which can be watched live via SlidesLive or Zoom, and (2) poster sessions for accepted papers and community roundtable discussions, which are hosted in <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather Town</a>.</p>

								<p>Gather Town is an interactive online environment where you can walk around and browse the posters, and interact with poster presenters, workshop organizers, and other attendees. This is the same setup used by the NeurIPS main conference, and you can see an introductory video about Gather Town poster sessions <a href="https://slideslive.com/38946995/poster-sessions-in-gathertown">here</a>.</p>

								<p><b>Registration:</b> You need to have a NeurIPS registration in order to attend and/or present your poster at this workshop. For registration please refer to <a href="https://neurips.cc">NeurIPS 2021 website</a>.

Each accepted poster is assigned to one of four poster rooms in Gather Town, and you can find the poster room number of each poster in the list below. The schedule includes two identical poster sessions, 1.5 hours each, scheduled at different times to account for different time zones the participants are connecting from. We expect each accepted paper to be presented in at least one poster session but encourage the presenters to present at both sessions if possible. In order to access Gather Town, you need to be signed into your <a href="https://neurips.cc/">NeurIPS account</a> with a valid NeurIPS registration.</p>

									<!--

									<p>In this targeted workshop, we aim to bring together physical scientists and machine learning researchers who are interested in applying machine learning to various outstanding physical problems; or are using physical insights to understand and improve machine learning techniques.</p>

<p>We invite researchers to submit work particularly in the following and related areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-impact applications of machine learning to physical sciences, experiment or theory</li>
<li>Strategies for incorporating prior scientific knowledge into machine learning algorithms</li>
<li>Application of physical sciences to understand, model and improve machine learning techniques</li>
<li>Machine learning model interpretability for obtaining insights to physical systems</li>
<li>Any other area related to the subject of the workshop, including but not limited to techniques that are relevant to physical systems such as generative models, likelihood-free inference, variational inference, simulation-based inference, probabilistic models and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions of completed projects as well as high-quality works in progress are welcome. Submissions will be kept confidential until they are accepted and authors confirm that they can be included in the workshop. If a submission is not accepted, or withdrawn for any reason, it will be kept confidential and not made public.</p>

<p>Accepted work will be presented as posters during the workshop. Several accepted submissions will be selected for contributed talks. Please note that at least one coauthor of each accepted paper will be expected to have a NeurIPS conference registration that includes the workshop session and participate in one of the virtual poster sessions.</p>

<h3>Important note for work that will be/has been published elsewhere:</h3>

<p>All accepted short papers (extended abstracts) will be made available on the workshop website. This does not constitute an archival publication or formal proceedings; authors retain full copyright of their work and are free to publish their extended work in another journal or conference. We allow submission of extended abstracts that overlap with papers that are under review or have been recently published in a conference or a journal, including physical science journals. However, we do not accept cross submissions of the same content to multiple workshops at NeurIPS.</p>



									<h3>Submission instructions</h3>


									<p>Submissions should be anonymized short papers (extended abstracts) up to 4 pages in PDF format, typeset using the <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NeurIPS style</a>. The authors are required to include a NeurIPS paper checklist, designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. The paper checklist should come after the main paper content (see <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist">NeurIPS paper checklist guidelines</a>). The paper checklist and references do not count towards the page limit. Appendices or supplementary material are discouraged, and reviewers are not expected to read beyond the first 4 pages and the impact statement. A workshop-specific modified NeurIPS style file will be provided for the camera-ready versions, after the author notification date.</p>


									<p>Submissions page is <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4PS2021">here</a>. </p>

									<a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4PS2021" class="button">Submit paper</a>
									<p></p>

									<h2>Instructions for Accepted Papers</h2>

									<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to upload their camera-ready (final) paper and a poster by the deadlines given on this page. Optionally they can also record a short (5-minute) video describing their work.</p>

									<h3>Camera-ready papers</h3>
									<p>Please produce the "camera-ready" (final) version of your accepted paper by replacing the "neurips_2021.sty" style file with the "neurips_2021_ml4ps.sty" file <a href="files/neurips_2021_ml4ps.sty">available here</a> and using the "final" package option (that is, "\usepackage[final]{neurips_2021_ml4ps}") to include author and affiliation information. The modified style file replaces the first page footer to correctly refer to the workshop instead of the main conference. It is acceptable if your paper goes up to five pages (excluding acknowledgments, references, paper checklist and any appendices if present) due to author and affiliation information taking extra space on the first page. The five-page limit is strict, and appendices are allowed but discouraged. Authors are encouraged, though not required, to include the <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist">NeurIPS Paper Checklist</a> at the end of the paper (not counted in the page limit).</p>

									<p>Please revise your paper as much as you can to reasonably address reviewer comments. The revision would include minor corrections and/or changes to directly address reviewer comments. Beyond these points, it is not acceptable to include any significant new material that was not present in the reviewed version of your paper.</p>

									<p>Please upload the final PDF of your paper by the camera-ready deadline, by logging in to the <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4PS2021">CMT website</a> (the same one used for the submissions) and using the camera-ready link shown with your existing submission.</p>

									<h3>Posters</h3>

									<p>The poster sessions will take place virtually in two <a href="https://gather.town/">GatherTown</a> sessions. Posters will be presented during live and interactive sessions with virtual poster boards, where the presenter and the participants will be able to interact with audio and video. You will have control of your audio and video and can turn them on and off at any point as you wish. GatherTown is quite fun and it emulates a physical poster session venue where attendees can freely walk from poster to poster and interact in groups with the presenters through audio/video. Posters will be visible in full within the GatherTown platform and the attendees will have the possibility to zoom in to parts of your poster.</p>


									<p>Please prepare an A0 landscape poster. The landscape orientation ensures that your poster is seen best in computer screens. We have observed a regular A0 format (as one would prepare for an in-person poster session where the posters are printed on A0 paper) also works fine in the GatherTown interface.</p>
